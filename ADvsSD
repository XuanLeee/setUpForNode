Attribute Directives:
1 like the normal HTML Attribute (possibly with databinding or event binding)
2 Only affect/change the element they are added to
Structural Directives:
1 normal HTML Attribute with * (for desugaring)
2Affect the while area in the Dom(element added/removed)

with the * at the begining, angular transfer the directive into something else:
<div *ngIf="!onlyOdd"></div>
as same as:
<ng-template [ngIf]="!onlyOdd></ng-template>
define custom structural directives:
in unlessDirective class:
@Input() set appUnless(condition: bollean){
if(!condition){
this.vcRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templateRef);
}
else{
this.vcRef.clear();
}

}//condition change will execute this method
constructor(private templateRef:TemplateRef<any>,private vcRef:ViewContainerRef){
}
in html file:
<div *appUnless=""></div>
