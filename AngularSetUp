Create new angular project 


        ng new my-first-app
      
      
ng: refer to angular cli

then cd my-first-app/

         ng serve 
         
ng serve is to build source code, for example make typeScript into javaScript
then go to the localhost:4200
First app running : app works!

Open the editor:
1 src/app is the file we need to deal with
2 app works comes from app.component.ts (.ts is typeScript, which is the high level of javaScript)
3 if change app works title into something else, server will keep running all the time, rebuild and reload automatic
4 app.component.html : angular change html code into dom in the run time. 
5 in angular, we use component to change our page
