Angular  : A command line interface for Angular
 
 
         sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
        
        
-g: global install
@angular/cli : the package name
sudo is only need for linux and mac


Create new angular project 


        ng new my-first-app
      
      
ng: refer to angular cli

then cd my-first-app/

         ng serve 
         
ng serve is to build source code, for example make typeScript into javaScript
then go to the localhost:4200
First app running : app works!

Open the editor:
1 src/app is the file we need to deal with
2 app works comes from app.component.ts (.ts is typeScript, which is the high level of javaScript)
3 if change app works title into something else, server will keep running all the time, rebuild and reload automatic
4 app.component.html : angular change html code into dom in the run time. 
5 in angular, we use component to change our page

In app.component.html:
Traditional JavaScript need to set up listenner to get the change and value then output, in Angular we can use
square brackets[],with inside Parentheses () ,also called round brackets. Like this:
        <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">
        ngModel:Angular command
Then in app.component.ts we need set up name to connect with app.component.html :
export class AppComponent {
  name = '';
}

Then go back to the app.component.html:
 output is using double curly brackets{{}}:
 <p> {{name}} </p>
 then the page will auto reload with the name type.
 Most useful feature in angular is auto react with the page:)
