If using different links will refresh the page and lose data. 
Changing the different pages by routing is good way to avoid reload the page.
It not restart the application, keep update and fast than reload the page every time.
routerLink="/somename"
[routerLink]="[/somename]"
must be full path with / , or the sub-rounter cannot find the path
in the subfolder
const appRoutes:Routes=[
{path:'users'
}];
